âœ¨ðŸŒŸðŸ˜ˆ C03 EX05 EVIL TESTS ðŸ˜ˆðŸŒŸâœ¨

ðŸ˜ˆðŸ¤© Made by a psychopath with passion ðŸ¤©ðŸ˜ˆ

Happy path :)
	"Hello" " world" "12"
		-> 11 "Hello world"

#########################################

Oops wrong size, forgot \0
	"Hello" " world" "11"
		-> 11 "Hello worl"

Copy nothing
	"Hello" " world" "5"
		-> 11 "Hello"

I SAID NOTHING !!!
	"Hello" " world" "0"
		-> 6 "Hello"

Ok... A bit more
	"Hello" " world" "1"
		-> 7 "Hello"

More, more!!
	"Hello" " world" "3"
		-> 9 "Hello"

MOTTO HOSHII!!
	"Hello" " world" "99"
		-> 11 "Hello world"

#########################################

Why so negative!! (underflow converted to 4294967295)
	"Hello" " world" "-1"
		-> 11 "Hello world"

#########################################

Empty dest, size too small
	"" "world" "3"
		-> 5 "wo"

Empty dest, size still too small (\0 for null)
	"" "world" "5"
		-> 5 "worl"

Empty dest, size just enough
	"" "world" "6"
		-> 5 "world"

Empty dest, too much size
	"" "world" "18"
		-> 5 "world"

#########################################

Empty src, but why doing that ???
	"Hello" "" "0"
		-> 0 "Hello"

Empty src, a target size, but why doing that ???
	"Hello" "" "12"
		-> 5 "Hello"

#########################################

[X] Empty dest. Empty src. Does size matter ?
	"" "" "10"
		-> 0 ""

Uh ?
	"" "" "0"
		-> 0 ""

Uh ?????
	"" "" "5"
		-> 0 ""

#########################################

Special chars (should) do nothing here
	"\n" "\n" "3"
		-> 4 "\n" (remember - 2 + null)

Special chars (should) do nothing here too
	"\n" "\n" "4"
			-> 4 "\n\"

Special chars (should) do nothing here too too
	"\n" "\0" "5"
			-> 4 "\n\0"

Special chars (should) do nothing here 4
	"\x0" "\xa" "4"
			-> 6 "\x0"

#########################################

[X] src or dest not nulled
	No protection against these cases in the new version learned from
	newbsd... Will deepthought consider this as a problem?
