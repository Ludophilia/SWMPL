C07X05 游릭游댮

Evil tests made with 游땓游땓游땓 passion

Context : Create ft_split(char *str, char *charset), a function that split a
string str into multiple strings and store them into an array.
The number of str in the array depends on the separator charset, such as if 
charset is equal to " ", the str "hello world" is splitted into
["hello", "world"].

What kind of tests should we do here?
	-> See below
	
[游릭] Happy path :)
	"salut 칞a va" " "
		-> Expected 3 words
	"salutXYZ칞aXYZva" "XYZ"
		-> Expected 3 words

[游릭] Empty charset
	"lol" ""
		-> Expected 1 word
	"" ""
		-> Expected 0 word

[游릭] Charset longer than the str (len_str < len_charset)
	"bell" "bella"
		-> Expected 1 word

[游릭] Charset at the start of str
	" salut 칞a va" " "
		-> Expected 3 words
	"XYZsalutXYZ칞aXYZva" "XYZ"
		-> Expected 3 words
		
[游릭] Charset at the end of str
	"salut 칞a va " " "
		-> Expected 3 words
	"salutXYZ칞aXYZvaXYZ" "XYZ"
		-> Expected 3 words

[游릭] Charset at the start and end of str
	"XYZsalutXYZ칞aXYZvaXYZ" "XYZ"
		-> Expected 3 words

[游릭] Repeated charset
	"salutXXXXXXXcaXXvaXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" "X"
		-> Expected 3 words
	"salut 칞a va                     " " "
		-> Expected 3 words
	"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXsalutXXXXXXXcaXXvaXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" "X"
		-> Expected 3 words

[游릭] Incomplete charset
	"XYsalutXYZ칞aYZva" "XYZ"
		-> Expected 2 words
	"  salut  칞a va " "  "
		-> Expected 2 words

[游릭] Empty str
