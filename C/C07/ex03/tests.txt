C07X03 🟢🔴

Evil tests made with 😈😈😈 passion

Context : Create ft_strjoin(int size, char **strs, char *sep), a function
that concatenates an array of str of size size into a sigle str, with separators
sep BETWEEN each str.

What kind of tests should we do here?
	-> See below

[🟢] Basic examples
	- "2" "hello" "world" " "
		-> "hello world"
	- "2" "toi" "moi" " + "
		-> "toi + moi"
	- "3" "visit: www" "42" "fr" "."
		-> "visit: www.42.fr"
	- "4" "" "mnt" "nfs" "homes" "/" 
		-> "/mnt/nfs/homes"

[🟢] Empty strings
	- "2" "" "" "\-#?"
		-> "\-#?"
	- "5" "" "" "" "" "" "\-#?"
		-> "\-#?\-#?\-#?\-#?"
	- "2" "" "" "	"
		-> "	"
		
[🟢] There is ONLY one string - Why using join then?
	- "1" "" ""
		-> ""
	- "1" "Je..." ""
		-> "Je..."
	- "1" "EXPLOSION" "\!"
		-> "EXPLOSION"

[🟢] "Wow, wow, wow... Joining a lot there."
	- "8" "yoursite.com" "api" "json" "v5" "get" "ressource" "id" "110" "/" 
		-> "yoursite.com/api/json/v5/get/ressource/id/110"
	- "16" 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F "-"
		-> "0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-A-B-C-D-E-F"
	
[🟢] Empty or no separator
	- "3" "salut" "la" "mif" ""
		-> "salutlamif"
	- "2" "" "" ""
		-> ""
	- "4" "" "A" "" "B" ""
		-> "AB"
	- "8" "" "X" "" "Y" "" "" "" "Z" ""
		-> "XYZ"
	
[🟢] Too much separator
	- "2" "You" "Me" "		<------>		"
		-> 'You               <------>                Me'
	- "2" "FRA" "ALL" "		XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX		"
		-> 'FRA               XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX            ALL'
		
[🟢] No size
	- "0" "hello" "world" " "
		-> ""
	- "0" "" "" "\-#?"
		-> ""
	- "0" "EXPLOSION" "\!"
		-> ""

[🟢] Wrong size but enough strs (🌶️ hot case)
	- "1" "" "" "	"
		-> ""
	- "1" "hello" "world" " "
		-> "hello"
	- "1" "C'EST" " OUF \!\!" "..."
		-> "C'EST"
	- "-4" "Ich" "bin" "ein" "berliner" " "
		-> ""
		-> guard in main level blocks that kind of cases but "" is correct
		-> at source level, 0 < -3, so exception size == 0 is triggered. 
		At main level, strs = nil, so main prints this state.

[🟢] Wrong size but NOT enough strs (🌶️ hot case)
	- "5" "salut" "la" "mif" ""
		-> "salutlamif"
		-> Guards have been added to avoid relying only on size. Should have let
		the function do it's thing and return a segfault.
	- "10" "" "OUF"
		-> ""
		-> Only one str. What do you want to concatenate?
	- "20" "" "///"
		-> "" 
 	- "42" "welcome" "cadet" "_"
		-> "welcome_cadet"
