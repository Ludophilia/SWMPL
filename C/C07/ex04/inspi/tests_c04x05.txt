C04X05 🟢🔴

Evil tests made with 😈😈😈 passion

Goal : ft_atoi_base is a function that converts a number in a given base (given 
by the arg char *base) to an int in base 10.

This test is pretty much a mirror of those with from C04X04 with a the cases
specific to ft_atoi from C04X03

[🟢] OK, that's... kind of straightforward ? At least there is a lot of positive
things to it :))
