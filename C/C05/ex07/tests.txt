C05X07 🟢🔴

Evil tests made with 😈😈😈 passion

Context : ft_find_next_prime(nb) returns nb if it's a prime number, the next
prime if not.
A prime number is a number that has only two divisors: 1 and itself.

i is a divisor of nb if and only if nb % 0 == 0.

Every nb has 1 and itself as divisor. For a prime, those should be the only
ones.

[🟢] Mirror, mirror... Who is a primest number ? 

	"3"
		-> 3
	"23" 
		-> 23
	"53"
		-> 53
	"67"
		-> 67
	"191"
		-> 191
	"631"

[🟢] That's life: there always a number primer than you :/

	"0"
		-> 2
	"1"
		-> 2
	"15"
		-> 17
	"50"
		-> 53
	"76"

	time (gww ft_find_next_prime.c main.c && ./a.out "2147483629")
		-> below 0.1s total
	"2147483647"
		-> 2147483647
	time (gww ft_find_next_prime.c main.c && ./a.out "2147483647")
		-> below 0.1s total

[🟢] Again: Who has the luxury of being negative in his prime?
	"-1"
		-> 2
	"-5"
