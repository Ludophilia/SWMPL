Evil tests made with 😈😈😈 passion

Context : ft_is_prime(nb) returns 1 if nb is a prime number, 0 if it's not.
A prime number is a number that has only two divisors: 1 and itself.

i is a divisor of nb if and only if nb % 0 == 0.

Every nb has 1 and itself as divisor. For a prime, those should be the only
ones.

[🟢] Those integer are certainly primes...

[🟢] Who has the luxury of being negative in his prime?
